## Overview

Time Tracking Events let you track activities outside Calendar Events. Depending on your workflow, most of the time you spend working on a project is not in meetings. Time Tracking Events allow you to log this time and associate it with a Project.

**Note**: Time Tracking Events only exist in Yappa and are not pushed to any of your calendars.

You can create a Time Tracking Event straight from the Calendar View, by pressing Start and adding a title to the event. Then, when your task is over, you can press Stop. Time Tracking Events can be edited later to add more details, such as a description, refine the start and end time, and assign the event to a Project.
