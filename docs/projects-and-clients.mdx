Through Projects and Clients, you can organize your work and track time spent on different activities based on:
* calendar events
* time tracking events

Projects are the main entities in Yappa, and they can be associated with Clients (1 Client can have multiple Projects, but 1 Project can only belong to 1 Client).


## Tagging events

To associate an event with a Project, you can tag it through the Calendar View page. Click on the event and select the Project from the dropdown list.

To help you better understand how your time is spent, each Project has a colour associated with it. This colour is used to highlight the Project in the Calendar View page.

In the image above, some events have a coloured square next to the event title. This square represents the Project the event is associated with.


## Viewing Clients

Through the Clients page, you can view information about the time you spent on each Client, across Projects:
