The [Calendar View](https://app.goyappa.com/calendar), or the Calendar page, is the main view in Yappa where you can see all your calendar events across all your calendars, as well as time tracking events. It's designed to give you a clear overview of your day or week and help you manage your time effectively.

## Overview

At the top of the page you will find the Time Tracking panel, which allows you to start and stop a time tracking event. You can use this to track your ongoing activity and log it as a time tracking event in Yappa. Don't worry, you can always edit the event later if you need to.

Below, you will find the calendar component, which displays all your calendar events. Each event is color coded in two ways:

* the background color represents the calendar the event belongs to
* if the event belongs to a Project, the color of that project is displayed next to the event title

To view an event's details, click on the event. For calendar events, you can assign the event to a Project and navigate to the event in the original calendar (the link will take you to Google Calendar or Outlook Calendar).

For time tracking events, you can edit more details, such as title, description, start and end time and assign the event to a Project.
