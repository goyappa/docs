Calendar Synchronizations help you keep your calendars in sync across different calendar services. This is useful when:

* you use multiple calendar services and want to see all your events in one place
* you want to show your real availability in a client's calendar account without sharing your personal calendar
* you want to keep your personal and work calendars separate

... more


## Overview

During a Calendar Synchronization, event **clones** are created based on the Synchronization's configuration. A clone is a copy of an original event in a different calendar. A clone event contains minimal information:

* start and end time
* title (*)
* description (*)
* a link to the original event in the body of the description

(*) These fields are optional and can be configured in the Synchronization settings. See the section on 'private mode'.

A clone event will show you as 'Busy' for its duration. Furthermore, a clone event will **never** have other attendees, regardless of the original event's configuration. Simply put, the role of the clone is just to block your time in the target calendar.

## Creating a Synchronization

To create a new Calendar Synchronization, navigate to the [Synchronizations](https://app.goyappa.com/synchronizations) page and click on the "Add a synchronization" button. You will be presented with a form where you can configure the Synchronization.

### General settings

On the General tab you will find a number of settings which impact the information held by event clones, with a real-time preview of how the event will look in the target calendar.

#### Private mode

Private mode lets you create clone events that do not contain any identifiable information about the source event, namely title and description. Instead, the clone event will have a title of 'Busy'. This is useful when you want to keep the details of your original event private, such as when you wish to synchronize your
personal calendar to your work one.

**Note:** private mode applies to the entire synchronization. You cannot have some events synchronized in private mode and others not as part of the same synchronization.

### Synchronization types

There are two types of Synchronizations:
* One-way
* Multi-way

#### One-way Synchronization

A one-way Synchronization will create clone events in the target calendar(s) based on the events in the source calendar(s). 

#### Multi-way Synchronization

A multi-way Synchronization will create clone events in all calendars involved in the Synchronization, the end result being that all calendars in a Multi-Way Synchronization will show the same availability.


**Note:** Event clones are not displayed on the Calendar View page. They are only visible in the target calendar(s).
