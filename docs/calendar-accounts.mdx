All Yappa features require one or more Calendar Accounts to be set up. A Calendar Account is a connection to a calendar service provider - we currently support Google and Microsoft accounts (personal and work). More may be supported in the future.

## Adding a Calendar Account

To add a Calendar Account, navigate to the [Calendar Accounts](https://app.goyappa.com/calendar-accounts) page click on the "Add a calendar account" button. You can then choose which type of account you want to connect (Google or Microsoft) and follow the authorization process.

Yappa will ask for permission to view and manage all the calendars in your account. This is necessary for Yappa to be able to retrieve as well as create and update events on your behalf. You can always revoke this permission through your Google or Microsoft account settings.

As soon as Yappa is authorized, you will be redirected back to the Calendar Accounts page where you will see all the calendars that are available in the connected account.

From this page you can change the following settings at a calendar level:

* **Enabled**: If a calendar is enabled, Yappa will load events from it and make the calendar available for synchronizations.
* **Private**: Private calendars restrict the set of event fields that are loaded from the calendar provider. More information in the section below.
* **Color**: The color used to display events from this calendar on the Calendar page.


## Calendar privacy

When you set a calendar to “private” in Yappa, fewer event details are retrieved from the calendar provider. This keeps certain event information hidden within Yappa itself, as well as in any synchronized or linked calendars.

In Yappa’s Calendar View, events from private calendars appear only with the title *Private* and do not display any additional details, like the description or location.

**Note**: Yappa may still store more detailed information for events it directly creates, even if the calendar is private. Examples include:

* Cloned events created during calendar synchronizations.
* Bookings made through Yappa’s Booking Links feature.

This is because Yappa originates these events and sends this information to the calendar provider, rather than just reading it from an existing event. However, any **read-only** actions (retrieving existing event data) will respect the privacy setting, meaning Yappa will only access the allowed fields.

### Google

When Yappa reads data from a Google Calendar, it uses the `fields` query parameter to limit which data points it retrieves:

| Field | Private = off | Private = on |
|-------|---------------|--------------|
| id | ✅ | ✅ |
| status | ✅ | ✅ |
| start | ✅ | ✅ |
| end | ✅ | ✅ |
| transparency | ✅ | ✅ |
| summary | ✅ | ❌ |
| description | ✅ | ❌ |
| location | ✅ | ❌ |
| attendees | ✅ | ❌ |
| htmlLink | ✅ | ❌ |

For a complete list of fields that are available under Google Calendar API's *Event* resource, see the [Google Calendar API documentation](https://developers.google.com/calendar/v3/reference/events).


### Microsoft

When Yappa reads data from a Microsoft Calendar, it uses the `$select` query parameter to limit which data points it retrieves:

| Field | Private = off | Private = on |
|-------|---------------|--------------|
| id | ✅ | ✅ |
| responseStatus | ✅ | ✅ |
| start | ✅ | ✅ |
| end | ✅ | ✅ |
| showAs | ✅ | ✅ |
| isAllDay | ✅ | ✅ |
| subject | ✅ | ❌ |
| bodyPreview | ✅ | ❌ |
| location | ✅ | ❌ |
| attendees | ✅ | ❌ |
| webLink | ✅ | ❌ |

For e complete list of fields that are available under Microsoft Graph API's *Event* resource, see the [Microsoft Graph API documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/event?view=graph-rest-1.0#properties).

## Reauthorization

If Yappa has trouble accessing one of your Calendar Accounts, you will be prompted to reauthorize the account. This can happen if you revoke access to Yappa from your Google or Microsoft account settings or if the authorization expired. If this happens, the Calendar Accounts
page will reflect the error state for that account.
