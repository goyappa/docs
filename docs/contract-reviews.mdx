*Disclaimer: This feature is in beta. The Contract Reviews functionality does not provide legal advice.*

The Contract Reviews feature in Yappa allows you to analyse contracts typical to a freelancer's day to day activity, such as services agreements, non-disclosure agreements, terms of service and privacy policies of 3rd party services and more using AI. This feature is designed to help
you get a better understanding of the contracts you are signing and the risks associated with them, as well as identify key points that you should pay attention to. **Please note that the reviews are for information purposes only and do not form legal advice. You should always discuss legal issues with a trained professional.**

This feature is usage limited, meaning that each user has a certain allowance of contract reviews per period, as follows:

* Trial users: 2 contract reviews for the entire trial period
* Paid users: 5 contract reviews per month

Unused allowances do not carry over to the next period.

## How to use Contract Reviews

Go to the [Contract Reviews](https://app.goyappa.com/contract-reviews) page to start a review. You can upload a contract in PDF format - files have to be up to 10MB in size and can have at most 20 pages.

After you submit your file, your contract will be analyzed using AI and you may be answered a number of questions. The questions are designed to help the model understand the contract better and provide tailored feedback. If the contract you provide is not in English, you can also choose to have
the review generated in either English or the language in which the contract is written.

After you answer the questions, you will be provided with a Review which includes the following sections:

* Summary - a brief overview of the contract
* Highlights - key points that you should pay attention to
* Recommendations - suggestions on actions you may consider

For the Highlights and Recommendations sections, you can use the `Show references` button to see the specific parts of the contract that were used for each individual feedback point.

If the file you uploaded is not a document that can be reviewed, you will be notified and a review will not be generated. Were we wrong? Please use the `Support` button to let us know!
